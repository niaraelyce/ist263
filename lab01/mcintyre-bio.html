                My name is Niara McIntyre, and I am currently a Senior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management & Technology with a concentration in web design. In school, I excel in organization as well as communication skills throughout my different areas of study. I have been a consecutive recipient of the Deans list award, and I have maintained a 3.0 GPA. Outside of school, I am a substitute teacher for the Syracuse City school district. I teach Kindergarten through eighth grade, and this is my first teaching job thus far. My favorite hobby is to read, and binge my favorite movies like Harry Potter. I have a sister and two brothers, and we all are 2 years apart. I also have two pitbulls named Onyx & diamond. I love hanging out with my family and pets, and I look forward to another great year at SU!
