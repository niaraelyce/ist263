                      <p> My name is Niara McIntyre, and I am currently a Senior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and
                    Technology with a concentration in web design. In school, I excel in organization as well as communication skills
                    throughout my different areas of study. 
                </p>

                   <p>I have been a consecutive recipient of the Deans list award, and I have
                    maintained a 3.0 GPA. Outside of school, I am a substitute teacher for the Syracuse City school district. I teach
                    Kindergarten through eighth grade, and this is my first teaching job thus far. My favorite hobby is to read, and binge
                    my favorite movies like <strong>Harry Potter</strong>. 
                </p>

                  <p>I have a sister and two brothers, and we all are 2 years apart. I also have two
                    pitbulls named Onyx and diamond. I love hanging out with my family and pets, and I look forward to another great year at
                    SU.</p>
                    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

                    <p>Even though this is for a grade, I actually really enjoy this coding class with Professor Ferger.</p>
